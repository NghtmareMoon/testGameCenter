     TESTING GAMECENTER: THIS GAME WILL CONNECT UP TO 2 PLAYERS. TURN BASED GAME
     EACH TURN ONE PLAYER CAN CLICK BUTTON A OR B AND THEN END HIS TURN
     LOG WILL BE DISPLAYED: PLAYER X CLICKED A 10 TIMES AND B 20 TIMES AND TOOK X SECONDS FOR HIS TURN
     GAME WILL END AFTER EACH PLAYER HAS HAD 2 TURNS
     TEST CONNECTIVITY AND HOW TURN BASED GAMES WORK.
     
     MAIN THINGS TO TEST:
     - GAMEKIT AUTHENTICATION
     - GAMEKIT NETWORK INTERFACE (TURN-BASED GAMES)
     - UPDATING GAMES, ARE THEY SAVED IN GAMEKIT CLOUD OR DO THEY NEED TO BE STORED IN PHONE?
